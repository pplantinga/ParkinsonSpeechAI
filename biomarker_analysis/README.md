Analysis of Spectral Flux at Speech Boundaries
----------------------------------------------

This analysis was done as part of the work for the article "Discovering an Articulatory Speech Biomarker for Parkinson's Disease via Mechanistic Interpretability of Deep Learning".

The figures from the article can be found in the following files:

1. Both parts are in `boundary_ablation.ipynb`
1. Both parts are generated with `recipes/QPN/interpret/correlate_activations.py`
1. Both parts are in `BiomarkerComparison.ipynb`
